A data-driven personal website
======
CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!

As a data analyst with 1+ year of experience in data analytics, I am a detail-oriented professional with expertise in Python, SQL, R, Excel and Power BI and a passion for translating complex data into actionable insights. I am skilled in VLOOKUP, Pivot Tables, macros, formulas and charts in MS Excel and have experience in data visualization, data modelling, statistical analysis and machine learning. I am always eager to learn and improve my skills, and I am excited to leverage my expertise in data analytics to help organizations achieve their goals.

I love connecting with people so give me a shout here on LinkedIn! [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).
